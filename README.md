# infinite-tic-tac-toe
A (simple) GUI tic tac toe implementation using Python and tkinter. 

The game is easy. Its like normal tic tac toe, however you now only can place 3 tokens maximum. As soon as you place your fourth token the first placed token disappears.
You will see the token that is about to disappear fade a little. 

The game is a two player game.. So no computer or AI opponents only real life people, like friends...fam..?? ;-)

Run on command line: python tic-tac-toe.py
